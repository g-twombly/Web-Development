Why did you choose to start a fruit market?
We chose to start a fruit market because, with recent inflation, it is growing harder for students to buy affordable fresh produce. Here, we bring together local farmers and students to make these fruits available (in bulk and at lower prices) and assist farmers who may not easily find customers during this time.
How do I add a product to my cart?
Head to our homepage and browse our fruit products. Once you find a fruit you like, click on the image or fruit name. You will be redirected towards the product's page. Once you're there, you can click the add to cart button. You may check your final cart by clicking "cart" on the nav bar and remove items from the cart by clicking the "X" next to each product in the cart.
Can I customize my order?
Yes! We offer customization by quantity and text input once you click on the product's page. For example, if you're ordering bulk in apples, you can specify "no green apples" or "wrap in paper". This way we can further meet your needs. 
What kind of fruit do you sell?
We work with and support local farmers to supply all the fruits in our catalog. We sell a variety of fruits that are available to view on our homepage. If we cannot find local farmers for these fruits, we have found supply routes to import these fruits from Mexico which you may also filter for if you want to support those farmers.
I can't find the fruit I want. Is there a way to get them through "Community Gardening"?
Yes! If you have suggestions or concerns about our products, please proceed to the contact webppage and send us your email and a message. We will get back to you by email as soon as we can.
